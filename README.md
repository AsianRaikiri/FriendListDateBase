# My First Database 
This is my SQL Repository where I document the basic structure for my local Database, naturally without populating the Database
Hope this might be helpful to others.
If you have never worked with SQL before and have no clue how to even create a Database, then head to [freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY), it is an amazing Tutorial, all about the basics of Databases.
